Introduction
=================

CSBT (ChainLayer SBT) is an innovative type of non-transferable blockchain token, mined at the chain layer on the Erbie chain. CSBT not only inherits all the characteristics of traditional SBTs (Soulbound Tokens) but also enhances security and reduces invocation costs through the unique advantages of the Erbie chain.

Key Features:
----------------

Non-transferability:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CSBT shares the same non-transferability as traditional SBTs. Once allocated to an account or wallet, it cannot be transferred. This ensures the uniqueness and authenticity of CSBT as an identifier and proof of achievement.

Chain-layer Mining:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CSBT is mined with each block generated on the Erbie chain, making it more than just a simple token. It is a core component deeply integrated with the blockchain ecosystem.

Enhanced Security:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Leveraging the technological advantages of the Erbie chain, CSBT offers higher security in data transmission and storage, preventing potential malicious attacks and data tampering.

Reduced Invocation Costs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compared to traditional SBTs, CSBT significantly reduces invocation and usage costs through the optimized design of the Erbie chain, making it more affordable and efficient for users.

Web Data Assetization:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CSBT can serve not only as an identifier and proof of achievement but also as a means for mapping and assetizing web data, providing new possibilities for data management and utilization in the Web 3.0 era.

Conclusion:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CSBT (ChainLayer SBT) is a token innovatively developed on the Erbie chain, combining the advantages of traditional SBTs with technical improvements that enhance security and reduce costs. As a crucial component of next-generation blockchain technology, CSBT has broad application prospects in identity verification, community governance, and data asset management, aiming to provide robust support for the development of decentralized networks.
