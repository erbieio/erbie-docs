Incentive Mechanisms
======================================

As mentioned above, the ErbieChain protocol consists of two different types of blocks: ordinary blocks and empty blocks. Only ordinary blocks generate rewards; empty blocks do not yield any rewards.

According to the economic model design, The ERB for the current block is distributed to the validators of the previous block. The validators and stakers split the reward.


Incentive Allocation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ERB: Each block distributes incentives to 7 Validators and stakers staked to those validators.


Other Rewards: Users engaged in various activities within ErbieChain's ecosystem or contributing to ErbieChain have the opportunity to receive incentives such as ERB etc.
