Balance
===============
ErbieChain manages the balance of each validator's account, which comprises the following three components:

- General Account Balance

    The general account balance represents the digital currency amount in the account, which can be used for transfers, transactions, or transaction fees, among other things.

- Validator's Stake

    The validator's stake is the amount an account has staked upon becoming a validator. This amount is locked for a certain period and cannot be accessed during this time.

- Staker's Stake

    The staker's stake is the amount staked when an account intends to earn ERB reward. This amount is also locked for a specific period and is inaccessible during this time.
