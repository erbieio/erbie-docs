What is Erbie?
=================
Erbie is a Layer 1 public blockchain based on the DRE consensus algorithm, characterized by low energy consumption, high concurrency, and EVM compatibility. In addition to offering all blockchain services provided by the first-generation Ethereum, Erbie innovates with ChainLayer SBT at the chain layer to support the aggregation and assetization of web data, aiming to become a new generation application-oriented decentralized network.

To achieve these functionalities, Erbie employs several innovative technologies:

  - **Dynamic Random Election (DRE) Consensus Mechanism**:This is a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol suitable for fully asynchronous environments. The security properties of DRE are post-quantum secure.

  - **Multi-layer Blockchain Architecture**:Composed of the transport layer, blockchain layer, API layer, and application layer, this architecture ensures the security and efficiency of the Erbie network.


On-chain Data Assetization: The block rewards in Erbie consist of the native token ERB and CSBT.

ERB is Erbie's primary cryptocurrency used for paying on-chain gas fees, storage fees, and CSBT protocol invocation fees. It also serves as collateral for validators and stakers.

CSBT is a non-fungible token at the chain layer, produced with each block of the Erbie chain. It acts as a mapping medium for all web data. Unlike traditional SBTs, which circulate directly at the chain layer, CSBT inherits all the features of SBT while enhancing security and reducing invocation costs through Erbie.
