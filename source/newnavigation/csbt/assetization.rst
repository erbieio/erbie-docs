Assetization
=================

Through CSBT (ChainLayer SBT), web data can be assetized, transforming it from mere information storage into assets with economic value and tradability. CSBT deeply integrates web data with blockchain technology, leveraging immutability and high security to clearly record data ownership and usage rights on the chain.

Key Advantages:
------------------

Clear Data Ownership:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CSBT can map the ownership of web data onto the blockchain, ensuring the uniqueness and authenticity of the data. Each CSBT represents a specific data asset, enabling data owners to clearly prove their ownership.

Economic Value of Data:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With CSBT, web data can be endowed with economic value and traded in decentralized markets. Users can earn income by selling or leasing their data assets, providing a new revenue stream for data owners.

High Security and Transparency:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Leveraging blockchain characteristics, CSBT offers high security and transparency in the assetization of data. All data transactions and usage records are permanently recorded on the blockchain, preventing tampering and fraud.

Reduced Data Management Costs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Traditional data management methods are often costly and inefficient. Through the assetization of data with CSBT, data storage, transmission, and management become more efficient and economical, reducing the costs for businesses and individuals.

Implementation Pathways:
----------------------------

Data Mapping:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each CSBT can be mapped to specific web data, binding the data to the CSBT through the Erbie blockchain, ensuring immutability and uniqueness of the data.

Data Trading Platform:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Through a decentralized data trading platform, users can make their CSBT available for invocation. Interested buyers can directly pay to invoke the data via the protocol, achieving free flow of data.

Revenue Distribution:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CSBT holders can receive earnings based on the usage of their data. Smart contracts will automatically distribute these earnings, ensuring fair and transparent transactions.

By assetizing web data through CSBT, not only is data utilization efficiency and economic value enhanced, but the construction of a decentralized data economy is also promoted, providing a solid foundation for a data-driven future.
