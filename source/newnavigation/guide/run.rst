Run a node
=================
Running your own node gives you various benefits, opens up new possibilities, and helps support the ecosystem. This page will guide you through setting up your own node and participating in validating ErbieChain transactions.

Environment and hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Local or cloud
-------------------------
ErbieChain clients are able to run on consumer grade computers and don't require any special hardware, like mining machines for example. Therefore, you have various options for deploying the node based on your needs. To simplify, let's think about running a node on both a local physical machine and a cloud server:
    Cloud
        - Providers offer high server uptime and static public IP addresses
        - Getting dedicated or virtual server can be more comfortable than building your own
        - Trade off is trusting a third party - server provider
        - Because of the required storage size for full node, the price of a rented server might get high
    Own hardware
        - More trustless and sovereign approach
        - One time investment
        - An option to buy preconfigured machines
        - You have to physically prepare, maintain, and potentially troubleshoot the machine and networking

Hardware
----------

All clients support major operating systems - Linux, MacOS, Windows. This means you can run nodes on regular desktop or server machines with the operating system (OS) that suits you the best. Make sure your OS is up to date to avoid potential issues and security vulnerabilities.

Minimum requirements

    - CPU with 2+ cores
    - 8 GB RAM
    - 2TB SSD
    - 10+ MBit/s bandwidth

Recommended specifications

    - Fast CPU with 4+ cores
    - 16 GB+ RAM
    - Fast SSD with 2+TB
    - 25+ MBit/s bandwidth

Spinning up the node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before installing the client, make sure that your computer has enough resources to run it. For detailed steps, you can refer to the `Start a node on ErbieChain <https://www.erbie.io/erbiedocs/install/run/deploy/>`_ documentation page, which provides a comprehensive guide to all the necessary steps involved in running a node and participating as a validator.
